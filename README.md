# Used Cars

The purpose of this analysis was to use SQL to find affordable luxury cars from Craigslist. First, I downloaded scraped data from Craigslist. I then created the table in SQL and imported the data, changing the data types when necessary. I then wrote queries to create a table of just luxury cars, and another of just luxury cars under $20,000. My next steps will be to add in more data sources to do more in-depth analysis.
